    <h4><b>Semantic Rule Mining</b></h4> 
    <p>Application which takes as input the full <a href="https://dahcc.idlab.ugent.be/dataset.html">protego KG</a> and tries to derive usefull rules to detect a life-style activity. The rule derivation process is performed by the semantic rule miner <a href="https://github.com/IBCNServices/INK">INK</a>. All sources and a brief description on how to run this application can be found  <a href="https://github.com/predict-idlab/DAHCC-Sources/tree/main/Applications/RuleMining">here</a></p>

    <h4><b>Semantic Stream Reasoning</b></h4> 
    <p>Application which takes as input a semantified stream of observations on which a predifened shower query is evaluted. When the C-Sparql reasoning module triggers the defined query rule, a new semantic prediction is made for that particular shower event. Both the transformation of the raw data to a semantic format as well as the whole reasoning module are made available <a href="https://github.com/predict-idlab/DAHCC-Sources/tree/main/Applications/StreamReasoning">here</a>. The application also shows how such rule queries can be registered on the fly.</p>
